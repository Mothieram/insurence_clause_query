        "direct_answer": "A floater health insurance policy covers multiple individuals (usually family members) under a single policy and a single sum insured.  Claims from any covered individual reduce the overall sum insured. An individual health insurance policy covers only one person, with their own separate sum insured.  Claims against one individual's policy do not affect the coverage of others.",

          "The specific coverage details, including the sum insured and covered individuals, vary depending on the policy and insurer.",
          "Floater policies can be more economical than purchasing individual policies for each family member, but the sum insured is shared.",

          "A family floater policy with a \u20b9500,000 sum insured might cover a family of four. If one member incurs \u20b9300,000 in claims, only \u20b9200,000 remains for the rest of the family for the policy year.",
          "Four individual policies, each with a \u20b9125,000 sum insured, would provide each family member with independent coverage of \u20b9125,000."
