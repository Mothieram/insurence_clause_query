        "direct_answer": "A floater health insurance policy covers multiple individuals (usually family members) under a single policy and a single sum insured.  Claims from any covered individual reduce the overall sum insured. An individual health insurance policy covers only one person, with their own separate sum insured.  Claims against one individual's policy do not affect the coverage of others.",
        "qualifications": [
          "The specific coverage details, including the sum insured and covered individuals, vary depending on the policy and insurer.",
          "Floater policies can be more economical than purchasing individual policies for each family member, but the sum insured is shared.",

          "A family of four with a \u20b910 lakh floater policy: If one member uses \u20b95 lakh, only \u20b95 lakh remains for the rest of the family.  Four individual \u20b910 lakh policies would allow each member to use their full \u20b910 lakh.",

        "direct_answer": "A higher claim settlement ratio generally indicates a greater likelihood that the insurer will pay out claims efficiently and fairly.
